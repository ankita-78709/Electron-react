            <p>I love being a frontend developer as it is worthy to create applications that the users will actually see. For me satisfying the look and feel of the application as per the user is everything.</p>
            <p>In the span of 2.4 years i have developed aplications related to Banking domain, Career domain and Flight domain. I have worked as a Full Stack developer for a year and was responsible for building web application frontend using React and Redux and backend using NodeJS and Express.
                Since the last few months I have been working as a React Develeper and built a desktop application using electron-react-boilerplate with the concept of hooks and redux-toolkit.</p>
            <p>I also involve myself in Buisness reqquirement and enhancement sessions to provide my feedback and observations in the application.</p>
            <p>I have worked alone in the project for close to a month due to unfavourable condition in the project and was appreciated for the same.</p>
